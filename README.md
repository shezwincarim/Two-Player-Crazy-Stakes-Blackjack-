# Two-Player-Crazy-Stakes-Blackjack-
The  two-player  game  works  like  this:  Each  player  is  dealt  cards  with  corresponding  point  values. 
Each player tries to reach a total of 21 without exceeding that amount. Each of the numbered cards 
is counted as their face values. An ace may be counted as either 1 or 11 (whichever is best for the 
player), and any jack, queen, or king is counted as 10. This game is to be played as a team of two 
players where either of the players is playing against the house. The computer is the house (or the 
casino) and competes against both players. Both players as a team are trying to reach an average 
of 21.  
At the beginning of each game, each player and the house are dealt two cards after shuffling the 
card deck. The players can see all their cards, along with their total. However, one of  the house’s 
cards is hidden for the time being by keeping it face down. So, neither the players  nor the house 
knows the value of the hidden card. 
Now, each player has the chance to take one additional card at a time for as long as they wish. If a 
player’s total exceeds 21 (known as busting), the player loses the game but still has a chance two 
win  if  the  team’s  average  does  not  go  over  21.  After  both  players  have  had  the  chance  to  take 
additional cards, the house will reveal its hidden card.  
The house must then take additional cards as long as its total is 16 or less. If the house busts,  the 
team of players wins. Otherwise, the average of both the players' totals is compared to the house’s 
points. The players win if the average of the players’ totals is greater than the house’s total.  The 
players lose if their average is less than the house’s total. If the two totals are the same, the player 
ties the house (also known as pushing).
